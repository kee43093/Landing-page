  <h1 class = "intro">About me<h1>

  <p>My name is Kendall Kee, I am from Shelby, NC, a small city outside of charlotte. 
I grew up with interest in technology starting from a pc game by the name of Dark Age Of Camelot.
I played this game throughout middle school all through college. 
The game died 5-6 years ago because of mixture of other pc games and bad management from my understanding.
