     My name is Kendall Kee, I am from Shelby, NC, a small city outside of charlotte, NC.
 My focus has shifted in the past 2 years from athletics to career based skills. My field of choice
 is software developing with a focus on front end for now. My ultimate goal is to help develop pc or video primarily
 based of Dark Age Of Camelot.This is where my interest in technology started. I played this game throughout middle school all through college.
 The game died 5-6 years ago because of mixture of other pc games and bad management from my understanding.</p>
